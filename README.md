# add-detectors
This program can use to add different detectors in the same theta angle. Need to input calibration informarion.

add152.C  add30.C : input the calibration coefficients of the detectors.                                      

find_channel.C : It can find the position of a peak, using gaus fit. There is a prominent peak in the spectrum, and its position is uncertain.
